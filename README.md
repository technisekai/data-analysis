1. Week 3 - Quiz 1

    This notebook is about machine learning that uses naive_bayes classifier (GaussianNB, BernoulliNB, and MultinomialNB) to solve titanic dataset. I got the highest accuracy at 82% uses BernoulliNB and MultinomialNB
    
2. Week 3 - Quiz 2
    
    Analysis 3 datasets and visualization.
3. Week 4 - Quiz 1
    
    Analysis dataset of crops production in states and districts.The conclusions is the widest area in states or districts is not affected to crops production and there is many widest area in states or districts that have lower production.
